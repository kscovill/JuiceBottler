	For this lab, I began by trying to understand the given Plant class and how it creates threads and be able to replicate that.
Once I understood it, i almost copied it directly for the worker class and began to tweak it in the run method to make it do what i want.
One problem I had was deciding which worker would do which step. I solved this by adding another parameter to the worker constructor that
told which worker it was, alternatively I could've set a worker Id every time I created a worker or in a for loop somewhere else before i started
the workers. After that it was just figuring out what was causing IllegalThreadStateExceptions and NullPointerExceptions. I solved this by adding 
a small wait between plant classes. With having a plant that has 5 workers where each worker does a single job thus accomplishing the goal of no worker can 
complete an entire orange. It also runs in threads, or in Parallel and has the ability to run multiple plants.I wrote probably 95% or more of my code, 
but I did receive help with code from Cordell Anderson and bounced ideas back and forth with Natalie Husband to understand what was needed.
